Immersion VR is an interactive building inside which the user can move around, change materials and use a lift. An important aspect of this project was to design a remarkable, intuitive user experience.

## Creating a pleasant experience

When designing the controls, I read [The Design of Everyday Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) by Don Norman and the paper [Visual Design Methods for Virtual Reality](http://aperturesciencellc.com/vr/VisualDesignMethodsforVR_MikeAlger.pdf) by Mike Alger. Both proved to be very helpful in the beginning phase of designing the controls.

<!-- In The Design of Everyday Things, I have learned about Discoverability, for example, which states that the user should always be able to find out which actions are possible and how to do them. For that reason, I added some helper texts to the controller, which show what the user can do at any given moment. -->

<!-- In Visual Design Methods for Virtual Reality, I have learned a lot  -->

Observing people who had never used a VR headset before try out the application was also very insightful. These tests helped me see things that were unintuitive and provided ideas on how to improve them.

<VideoBlock video="hands" :onLeftSide="true" title="Hands and Controllers" desc="To make the user feel more immersed, I opted to display their hands and a simplified version of the Oculus Touch controllers. The simplified version of the controllers is made out of only the top of the controllers, which hides some buttons that aren't used in the application and allows the user to better see their hands." />

<ImageBlock image="immersion_lines.jpg" :onLeftSide="false" title="Choosing a surface" desc="In order to change the surface's material, the user has to point at it with their index finger of their dominant hand, which then either shows a red or green line. If the line is green, the user can change the material by clicking the A button (or the X, if the user is left-handed). If the user presses the A (or X button) when the line is red, an error sound is played and the controller slightly vibrates." />

<VideoBlock video="matchange" :onLeftSide="true" title="Clicking on materials" desc="After choosing a surface, a selection of materials appear. The currently active material is highlighted, and the user can choose a new one by pressing it with the index finger. The material selection can be closed by moving the hand to the green checkmark sphere." />

<VideoBlock video="teleport" :onLeftSide="false" title="Moving around" desc="Moving in virtual reality is a complicated topic since the user's brain often is confused when moving in VR, but not in the real world. For this reason, I implemented a teleportation mechanism, where a parabolic arc shows where the user will be teleported to." />

<VideoBlock video="lift" :onLeftSide="true" title="Lift" desc="As a fun little feature, I made a functional lift. The user simply has to stand in front of it to open the doors. When the user enters, the doors are being closed and the lift starts moving." />

<VideoBlock video="tutorial" :onLeftSide="false" title="Interactive tutorial" desc="During an interactive tutorial at the beginning of the experience, the user is prompted to do various tasks, which helps them learn the controls." />

<ImageBlock image="immersion_helper.jpg" :onLeftSide="true" title="Helper texts" desc="During the experience, small helper texts appear next to the controller, which remind the user how to do something." />

<VideoBlock video="position" :onLeftSide="false" title="Telling the user where the UI is" desc="If a user is standing too close to an object when wanting to change materials, the material selection will appear to the left, to the right or behind them. To avoid confusion, the voice from the tutorial will tell the user where the material selection appears." />


## Designing the building

<ImageBlock image="immersion_sketches.jpg" :onLeftSide="true" title="Sketching" desc="To come up with ideas for the building, I did a lot of collecting reference photos and inspiration, sketching concepts on paper and then blocking them out in Blender." />

<ImageBlock image="immersion_modeling.jpg" :onLeftSide="false" title="3D Modeling" desc="3D Modeling was done using Blender. Blender's great viewport options allowed to quickly see how the foyer looks with lights shining through the windows and some basic materials applied." />

<ImageBlock image="immersion_baking.jpg" :onLeftSide="true" title="Baking" desc="For a lot of the models in the scene, I created a high poly version and a low poly version. The normals of the high poly version were then baked in Substance Painter and applied to the low poly version to create a highly detailed look while having an efficient 3D model." />


#### Texture Creation{style="text-align:center"}
For this project, I created a bunch of materials in Substance Designer and reused some I've already created for cgbookcase.com. I also published [breakdowns of two materials created for this project](https://www.cgbookcase.com/learn/immersion-vr-substance-designer-material-breakdowns).


### Results

Here are some screenshots from the building in its final state. The images are lightly edited.

## Development
Development was done using Unreal Engine 4 and C++. I had no prior experience working with C++ and almost none using Unreal Engine 4, so this was the most time-consuming part.

The entire code of this project can be found on it's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dorianzgraggen/ImmersionVR).

## Further information
This project was done as my "Maturit√§tsarbeit" (kind of a final thesis or project) at the school I was going to.
