Over the last few years, I've created more than 450 PBR textures and made them available under the CC0 License.

## PBR Map Types
All PBR textures on cgbookcase.com come with multiple types of maps. These maps are used to describe different properties of a surface at any given point.

The following blue and purple normal map, for instance, is used to describe which direction any point on the fabric is facing.

The textures on cgbookcase.com follow the Metalness/Roughness workflow and usually come with four to six different types of maps.

<!-- ::: projectul 
- Base Color: The color of a surface
- Roughness: How rough a surface is on a microscopic level
- Metallic: Which parts of a surface are metallic and which are not
- Normal: In which direction any point on the surface is facing
- Height: Height differences within a surface

## Creation Methods
Most of the textures were created using one out of two methods: Photographed or procedurally generated. Photographed textures are created by shooting multiple photos of a surface from a top-down view, stitching them together, making them tileable and creating the different map types.

For photographed textures, I use RawTherapee for RAW editing, Image Composite Editor for stitching, Affinity Photo for making them tileable, and Substance B2M or Alchemist for making the different map types.

For procedurally generated textures, I use Substance Designer. More on how a procedural material is created can be read in the [material breakdowns for Immersion VR](https://www.cgbookcase.com/learn/immersion-vr-substance-designer-material-breakdowns).
