description: Over the last few years, I've created more than 400 PBR textures and released them to the public domain. The textures are made out of four to six different types of texture maps.

I'm starting to offer scanned 3D models on cgbookcase.com in late June, 2020. The first release is going to be fruit scans, with vegetable, stones and plants coming soon, too. All models will come with multiple LODs (levels of detail) and PBR textures.

Here's a sneak peak:
